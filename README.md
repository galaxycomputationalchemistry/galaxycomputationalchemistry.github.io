#GalaxyC Community

GalaxyC is a community interested in creating and sharing cheminformatics and computational modelling tools for use with the Galaxy Project.

## Current Initiatives
- Galaxy Computational Chemistry in a box. Leverage from https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable and https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-chemicaltoolbox and include computational Chemistry Datatypes and wrappers for open source MD tools.
